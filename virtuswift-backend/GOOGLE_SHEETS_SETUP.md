## üõ°Ô∏è Security Best Practices

### 1. Protect Credentials
- Never commit `.env` file to version control
- Use environment variables in production
- Rotate service account keys regularly

### 2. Limit Access
- Use principle of least privilege
- Only share spreadsheet with necessary accounts
- Monitor access logs regularly

### 3. Data Privacy
- Implement data retention policies
- Regular backup of important data
- Consider data encryption for sensitive information

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

**1. "Service account not found"**
- Check if service account email is correct
- Verify the spreadsheet is shared with service account

**2. "Insufficient permissions"**
- Ensure service account has "Editor" access to spreadsheet
- Check if APIs are enabled in Google Cloud Console

**3. "Private key format error"**
- Ensure private key includes `\n` characters
- Wrap private key in quotes in .env file

**4. "Spreadsheet not found"**
- Verify spreadsheet ID is correct
- Check if spreadsheet exists and is accessible

### Debug Commands:
```bash
# Check service status
curl http://localhost:5000/api/sheets/health
